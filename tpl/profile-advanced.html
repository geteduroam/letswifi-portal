			<p>
				Encrypting your profile requires you to enter the passphrase once when installing the profile.
				Since the profile is usually installed rightaway after downloading it,
				this will typically not lead to better security.
			<p>
				However, there are some systems, usually aimed at professional users,
				that will refuse to import a profile unless it has a passphrase.
				Setting the passphrase here will thus make it easier to install
				the profile on such systems.
